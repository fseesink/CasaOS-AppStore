      SearXNG is a free internet metasearch engine which aggregates results from up to 245 search services. Users are neither tracked nor profiled. Additionally, SearXNG can be used over Tor for online anonymity.

      By default SearXNG will use port `8888`. After deploying the container, you can change the host port mapping to match whatever new port you choose.

      See [SearXNG Documentation](https://docs.searxng.org) for more details.
