# CasaOS AppStore

This is a fork of the original [CasaOS AppStore](https://github.com/iceWhaleTech/CasaOS-AppStore), created for my own use so I can add other apps.

>Forking, however, meaning carrying over the entire git history, creating a repo of > 200MB for something that takes up ~1MB once done.  As there is no intention to do pull requests/etc., in the end, I did a `git clone --depth 1 ...` of the repo, then deleted the repo on GitHub, recreated the repo as an empty repo, and pushed just my version thereof back to GitHub all to save space.  The entire repo is now ~1.1MB.  But I still want to give credit to the folks behind all this.
